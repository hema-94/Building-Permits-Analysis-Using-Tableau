OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY

This data gives way to analyse the permits issued by the Department of Buildings in the City of Chicago from 2006 to present. If the Department of Buildings has permit, or inspection history for a building address, a search will return a report with applicable permit, amount paid/waived.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT

The Department of Buildings supports the safety and quality of life for the residents and visitors of the City of Chicago through enforcement of the Chicago Building Code.  The permitting and inspection process promotes high quality design standards as well as the conservation, rehabilitation and reuse of the City's existing buildings. 

The following permit types give information about the various kinds of permits being issued.
Permit type: "New Construction and Renovation" includes new projects or rehabilitations of existing buildings; "Other Construction" includes items that require plans such as cell towers and cranes; "Easy Permit" includes minor repairs that require no plans; "Wrecking/Demolition" includes private demolition of buildings and other structures; "Electrical Wiring" includes major and minor electrical work both permanent and temporary; "Sign Permit" includes signs, canopies and awnings both on private property and over the public way; "Porch Permit" includes new porch construction and renovation (defunct permit type porches are now issued under "New Construction and Renovation" directly); "Reinstate Permit" includes original permit reinstatements; "Extension Permits" includes extension of original permit when construction has not started within six months of original permit issuance. 

There are work descriptions that indicate the type of work being done on the issued permit, which is printed on the permit. For instance, PIN1 – PIN10: A maximum of ten assessor parcel index numbers belonging to the permitted property. PINs are provided by the customer seeking the permit since mid-2008 where required by the Cook County Assessor’s Office. 
Contractor Information: The contractor type, name, and contact information. Data includes up to 15 different contractors per permit if applicable.
